# 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms in Python (LeetCode)

This repository documents my **systematic journey of mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Python**, primarily through **LeetCode** problems.

The goal is **deep understanding**, not memorization — focusing on **why** an approach works, **when** to use it, and **how** to recognize patterns.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build strong **problem-solving intuition**
- Master **core DSA patterns**
- Write **clean, efficient Python code**
- Understand **time & space complexity**
- Prepare for **technical interviews** and **FAANG-style questions**
